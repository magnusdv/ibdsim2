Description: Simulation of segments shared identical-by-descent (IBD) by
    pedigree members. Using sex specific recombination rates along the
    human genome (Halldorsson et al. (2019)
    <doi:10.1126/science.aau1043>), phased chromosomes are simulated for
    all pedigree members. Applications include calculation of realised
    relatedness coefficients and IBD segment distributions. 'ibdsim2' is
    part of the 'ped suite' collection of packages for pedigree analysis.
    A detailed presentation of the 'ped suite', including a separate
    chapter on 'ibdsim2', is available in the book 'Pedigree analysis in
    R' (Vigeland, 2021, ISBN:9780128244302). A 'shiny' app for visualising
    and comparing IBD distributions is available at
    <https://magnusdv.shinyapps.io/ibdsim2-shiny/>.
