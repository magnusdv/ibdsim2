Description: Simulation of segments shared identical-by-descent (IBD) by 
    pedigree members. Using sex specific recombination rates along the human
    genome (Halldorsson et al. (2019) <doi:10.1126/science.aau1043>), phased chromosomes
    are simulated for all pedigree members. Additional features include calculation
    of realised IBD coefficients and plots of IBD segment distributions.
