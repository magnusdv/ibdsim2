Description: Simulation of segments shared identical-by-descent (IBD) by 
    pedigree members. Using sex specific recombination rates along the human
    genome (Kong et. al (2010) <doi:10.1038/nature09525>), phased chromosomes
    are simulated for all pedigree members, either by unconditional gene 
    dropping or conditional on a specified IBD pattern. Additional functions 
    provide summaries and further analysis of the simulated genomes.
